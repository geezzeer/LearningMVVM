# LearningMVVM
Projects associated with trying to learn MVVM and WPF

I visualize MVVM as three side-by-side boxes.

On the left is the View. That's where the user interacts with the application.

On the right is the Model. That's where data is turned into information. 

In the middle is the View Model that interfaces the View and the Model.
